# Natural Selection's fact file
There isn't a proper index page here quite yet. However, just for your reference, this is the root directory for the fact files &mdash; some HTML documents which provide quick and persuasive information on Natural Selection's products. It is expected that there are as many fact files as there are products on the shelf, or maybe even more! üòù

You'll generally be directed here by scanning a QR code on one of our products. Each product has a unique QR code that contains a hyperlink to their corresponding fact file which gives "facts" about the product.

Each fact file contains our logo, the product's featured banner, and textual information about the product written in English and Thai. Each fact file has been carefully designed so as to be a quick and concise source of information with minimal aesthetics.
